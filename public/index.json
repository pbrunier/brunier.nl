The only thing left out of Docker is the backup.\nIn the past years I managed to move all my business activities, both end user computing and my servers to Open Source , and therefore I don‚Äôt suffer from vendor lock-in. My bookkeeping and VAT also has to be done using Open Source software. I use GNU Cash for this, but I have to admit that is a pain. But hey. No pain no gain üòâ\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/containerized_2021/","summary":"This evening I finished migrating my servers to 95% containerized workloads.","title":"Containerized"},{"content":"Today we had a very nice walk around the Flaes fen and the Reusel river near Esbeek. I took my Sony A7 II with me. All shots are made using my Helios M4 58mm and Zeiss Sonnar 135mm vintage lenses. As they are old lenses, they show some character, modern super engineered lenses do not.\nThe Helios is really soft when shooting long focal ranges, and the Zeiss shows some vignetting in in the corners. Getting to know these lenses is part of the vintage adventure. The A7 II itself shows itself to be a very nice camera. Although I will never use it to its full potential because of the manual lenses, the camera has a great image quality. The only downside until now, is the eyepiece of the EVF. I will replace this one with a bigger version. When it‚Äôs sunny, the piece isn‚Äôt able to shield your eye from the sun.\nZeiss Sollar 135mm Helios 4M 58mm ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/flaes_walk_2021/","summary":"Today we had a very nice walk around the Flaes fen and the Reusel river near Esbeek.","title":"Walk around the Flaes ‚Äì Esbeek"},{"content":"This weekend I made a great deal on a new camera. It‚Äôs a Sony A7 II full frame camera. Most people use such a beautiful camera with the latest and greatest lenses. I decided not to go that road.\nI‚Äôm now able to use vintage lenses in the way they were meant back in the day. The first lens I gave a try today is a Carl Zeiss Jena 135/3.5 export version. A lens from the DDR. I love its colors and sharpness and the manual interaction with it. I made some pictures in my garden.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/sony_a7ii_2021/","summary":"This weekend I made a great deal on a new camera.","title":"New camera "},{"content":"A while back I ran into a issue while using the OneDrive Nextgen Client (17.x) on Windows 10 while using VMWare UEM 9.2 as a profile management solution. The issue was easy to determine: Onedrive just did not start.\nAfter ruling out any AppLocker issues, I discovered it had something todo with the UEM process hooks. Blacklisting dllhost.exe, onedrive.exe and onedrivesetup.exe solved the issue. Then UEM 9.3 came out, which fixed the issue, and therefore the manual blacklist could be removed.\nRecently Onedrive 18.x surfaced. You know where I‚Äôm going? Right? No?\nThe problem is back again. No new version of UEM available.\nThank you Microsoft for delivering one of the most unstable platforms in human history. Thanks to VMWare for teaming up with, the possibly not existing, Q\u0026amp;A teams of Microsoft.\nI just put those 3 executables back in the blacklist, and it works for now.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/uem_vs_onedrive/","summary":"Issues with VMWare UEM and OneDrive","title":"VMWare UEM vs OneDrive"},{"content":"Today I went to the Black Hat Sessions 2017 in Ede (NL). I must say that the overall quality of the sessions was a bit less appealing than last year, but there was some interesting stuff out there.
