This weekend I made a great deal on a new camera. It’s a Sony A7 II full frame camera. Most people use such a beautiful camera with the latest and greatest lenses. I decided not to go that road.

I’m now able to use vintage lenses in the way they were meant back in the day. The first lens I gave a try today is a Carl Zeiss Jena 135/3.5 export version. A lens from the DDR. I love its colors and sharpness and the manual interaction with it. I made some pictures in my garden.
