Today Eloísa Romero sent me an email presenting me her EzTemp&RH crowdfunding project.

I really like it. It takes away a lot of the hassle you encounter when measuring temperature and humidity. It also features some quite precise components, including an auxiliary connection for an additional sensor of your choice. Great for an Raspberry Pi!

Take a look at the projectsite. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/easy-temperature-and-humidity-for-raspberry-pi
