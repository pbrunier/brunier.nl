Today I went to the Black Hat Sessions 2017 in Ede (NL). I must say that the overall quality of the sessions was a bit less appealing than last year, but there was some interesting stuff out there.
Especially the keynote by [Bill Cheswick](http://www.cheswick.com/ches/index.html) on the subject of “data”, and a session by [Duncan Campbell](http://www.duncancampbell.org/) called “A century of data stealing”, gave me a lot food for thought.

Recordings of the videos will become available at YT: https://www.youtube.com/user/MadisonGurkha
