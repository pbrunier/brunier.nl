After shipping, a month ago from the UK, today my Raspberry Zero finally arrived.
Besides the Rzero I also ordered a Zero Essentials Kit because of the HDMI converter and some nice 90 degrees header.

Iâ€™m not a huge fan of the Raspberries, but I had to buy this one because of the formfactor. Normally I prefer the Banana Pros a lot more than the Raspberries.
Not sure what the thing will be used for, but it looks nice.
I think I will put an XRF or XBee module on it, and keeping it as small as possible.

Added 1 Raspberry Zero to my stock of goodies.
