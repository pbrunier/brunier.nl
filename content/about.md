Hi, I’m Patrick Brunier. I’m a Dutch automation and data integration developer with also a lot of experience in enterprise system administration. This combination of skills gives me an advantage during automation challenges.
I’m a true open source enthusiast and try to play my part of this great movement.

You can hire me as freelancer, but I might also be interested in a more long-term employment. Please contact me through LinkedIn.

Feel free to take a look around. The blog section gives you a peek at what personally interests me, and might be useful for you.
